OpenDb Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

1) Requirements

To install the Open Media Collectors Database (OpenDb) on your site, you 
will need the following:

- WebServer (Apache 1.3, 2.x, IIS,...) - Apache is recommended, but IIS should work too.

- PHP 5.X
  	* track_vars must be enabled.
	* register_globals should be disabled.
	* php-mysql / php-mysqli module must be installed, so that PHP can access MySQL.
		
- MySQL Database 5.X

- SMTP server or PHP email configured.  If this is not possible, be sure to 
set the email configuration Mailer to 'none'.

2) Installation

Add the following lines to your Apache configuration (Assuming your Web server directory is in /srv/www/default
and your opendb was unpacked into opendb or there is a link called opendb):

<Directory /srv/www/default/opendb>
        Options FollowSymLinks
        order deny,allow
        deny from all
        allow from all
</Directory>

<Directory /srv/www/default/opendb/log>
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
</Directory>

On Ubuntu, create a file (with the content from above) called opendb.conf (in /etc/apache2/conf-available),
activate it using a2enconf opendb and restart apache (sudo service apache2 restart).

The installer can be activated by executing install.php (http://your.site.com/your.opendb.directory/install.php)

With appropriate credentials (The MySQL root user and its password, set during the MySQL installation),
the OpenDb installer can create the opendb database and user.

3) Upgrade

Unpack the zip / tar file in a new directory, do NOT overwrite the directory of the old installation!

A good idea is to use directories with version numbers and a link to the one currently in use with no
version number, e.g.

www-data@kaa:/srv/www/default$ ls -ald opendb*
lrwxrwxrwx  1 www-data www-data   13 Oct  9 09:27 opendb -> opendb-1.6.0/
drwxrwxr-x 21 www-data www-data 4096 Oct  9 09:27 opendb-1.5.0.8
drwxrwxr-x 18 www-data www-data 4096 Jun 30 23:14 opendb-1.6.0

Copy the necessary files from the old directory to the new:

cd opendb-1.5.0.8
tar cvf - itemcache/ upload/ log/ include/local.config.php | (cd ../opendb-1.6.0/ && tar xf -)

Point your web browser to the new directory:

https://your.site.com/opendb/

Now the installer takes over and guides you through the upgrade.

The install.php should be removed from the root directory of the opendb installation once
the install process is complete.

3) Backup

Backups are important. Backups are important. Backups are important.

E.g. a nice cronjob saving the whole database (not just a partial dump from within opendb!):

00 02 * * * /usr/bin/mysqldump opendb -u lender -pYourLenderPassword > /srv/www/default/opendb/log/opendb.dmp

Having done that, you can tar your /srv/www/default/opendb regularely, e.g. in the cronjob of the mysql dump. 
(Yes, there is a potential race condition, but let's ignore it at 0200 in the morning. If you want to play
safe, stop apache, dump the mysql database, tar the opendb directory, start apache.)

4) Moving from one server to another (if filesystem access is available)

If you did a backup as described above, piece of cake (assuming same MySQL and Apache versions, same php5 modules
installed):

- Install the opendb.conf file or make similar changes to your Apache2 setup as described above
- Unpack the tar file in your web server directory
- Create the database using the information (hostname,dbname,username,password) from include/local.config.php
mysql -u root -p
create database dbname; 
use dbname;
create user username@hostname identified by password;
grant all on *.* to username@hostname;
exit

mysql -u user -h host -p database < /srv/www/default/opendb/log/opendb.dmp

That is it. You can now point your web browser to http://newserver.com/opendb

6) Security

Be sure to delete the phpinfo.php file before going live with your site.  This file is 
provided for convenient problem resolution but represents a security risk to leave active.

Be sure to change the configured security hash to avoid potential security issues with CAPTCHA
functionality.
